# Challenges

There are three topics provided in this repository, but you can work on your own ideas if you prefer! There is also a introductory notebook (Intro_AI+QC.ipynb) that walks you through a high level overview of how AI can be used for quantum computing. 

1. Reservoir computing using a hybrid classical & quantum approach; work done in conjunction with Airbus (Classical-Quantum-Reservoir-Computing.ipynb)

2. Error mitigation using machine learning (ML_Quantum_Error_Mitigation.ipynb)

3. Using AI for developing decoders, work in progress, but see overview (AI_for_QEC.ipynb)!

# Registration 

Please register before September 15th using [this link](https://forms.gle/XDQ4Cam7abuPZP9j6). You must register to participate in the challenge to get early access to GPU features on qBraid. Use the same email address for registration and submissions. This email must be associated with your qBraid account. 

# Submissions
Submit your solutions by providing a link to your GitHub repository. Your repository should have a clear README that describes what challenge you have worked on, what your solution is, and how it improves upon previous work. Be sure to provide a minimal working example so judges can effectively grade your work. Don't forget to cite resources you use, and feel free to work in teams!

Submissions will be graded by a team from qBraid, and winners will be declared in the first week of November.

Submit your work using [this link](https://forms.gle/MnxLpjTQAJcMbe939).
